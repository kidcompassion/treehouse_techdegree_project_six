            No, you won't get high .... It's all good. It's all good, guys. Quit
            panicking. Quit panicking. No panic, no judgment. And you know, to sully
            and to contaminate or radically disrespect this union with a shameful
            contract is something I'll leave to the amateurs and the bible grippers.

            Robinson - a wonderful man at Morgan Creek, a great company - need to work
            out is they want me in it. If they do, it's a smash. If they don't, it's a
            turd that opens on a tugboat. And you know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired of
            pretending like my life isn't perfect and bitchin' and just winning every
            second .... And I'm not perfect and bitchin', and just delivering the goods
            at every frickin' turn. And Alex, try to get your mind around this, as a

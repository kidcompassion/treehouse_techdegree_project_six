# Static Node.js and Express Site
## Project 6


### About this project
This project is a portfolio website, generated by Express and using pug templates to display the content. Data is included in the data.json file in the root directory

I'm shooting for Exceeds Expectations on this project, and I am super eager for any feedback/criticism on how I've approached the project. You can be really nitpicky, as my goal is really just to practice and improve. :D

#### To meet the general project criteria, I've included:

* node_modules and .DS_Store are both in the .gitignore to avoid mistakenly committing them to the repo.
* all the dependencies are listed in my package.json file, so that running npm install will add them
* the app can be started by running node app.js

* data.json file is in the root
* it includes a prjects property, containing 5 project objects with the require fields (I added an extra one for the thumbnails featured on the home page, just to make the project easily scalable)

* renders routes '/', '/about', and 'projects/project/:id'
* sets up the static route to serve static files (although I had to tweak it a bit by setting a path var and updating the static method, because I was working in Chrome, which has a bug that prevents proper render of stylesheets)

* includes layout, about, index and project templates

#### To meet the exceeds expectation criteria, I've included:

* An error.pug template, with custom styles, which shows error.status, error.message and error.stack messages.
* Updated styles with a new font, a new color palette, some shadows on the buttons and CSS transition UI animations on multiple elements
* The ability for users to start the application by running npm start


#### To dos
* Add handling for the /projects page itself, which currently doesn't render anything.
